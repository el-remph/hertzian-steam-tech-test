After spending a good amount of time with the game, I can say that while I like Crusader Kings III, I’ll never feel as excited about it as I was with its predecessor. The leap from CK2 to CK3 feels minor in terms of gameplay evolution — outside of the graphical improvements, the core mechanics haven’t been significantly expanded upon.\n\nUnfortunately, the major issue that plagued CK2, namely repetitiveness, hasn't been adequately addressed. There are moments of brilliance, and it's still a fun game for those who enjoy grand strategy, but it lacks the depth and novelty to keep me as engaged as CK2 did over the years.\n\nIf you’re new to the series, CK3 is a solid place to start. But for veterans of CK2, the experience may feel more familiar than fresh.","timestamp_created":1726943416,"timestamp_updated":1726943416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.750007808208465576","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"hidden_in_steam_china":true,"steam_china_location":"","primarily_steam_deck":false},{"recommendationid":"174342936","author":{"steamid":"76561198081751814","num_games_owned":0,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":43729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":4265,"playtime_at_review":38867,"last_played":1727786408},"language":"english","review":"This is one of the most complex and immersive Medieval sim games. BUT a word of caution for new players. DO NOT buy this game if you are interested in in-depth medieval war strategy. War in this game is genuinely awful. Considering war makes up a large chunk of this game and medieval history it is by far the most boring and one-dimensional part of the game and can often be bugged out or have wars randomly invalidated. \n\nWhat this game is is more of a political simulator and via strategic marriages, alliances, schemes and factions.\n\nThe other thing with this game has is that almost everything relies on some form of chance (apart from war which is dull and flaccid). You don't play the game so much as it plays you by hurling events and situations your way with limited ways on how to play.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is the stress mechanic, which punishes play outside of your characters personality e.g. a compassionate person randomly insulting a vassal at a feast will give stress. It adds a great dynamic for role-playing. A bit like life, this game is very hard to control the outcomes and about 90% of the game (If you are playing a Duke or greater title) is crisis management.\n\nTo sum up\nPositives:\nGreat role-playing\nIntrigue is interesting and versatile\nTrue political sim\nTrue dynasty building\nInteresting historical events and regions\n\nNegatives:\nWar is dull considering how much of it is in the game\nDLCs are expensive and sometimes not worth the money (read reviews to see which are the best)\nRN-Jesus can bring a play-through catapulting to a halt via a series of unfortunate events\n\nI would recommend this game.\n","timestamp_created":1725615565,"timestamp_updated":1725615565,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.64841616153717041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"hidden_in_steam_china":true,"steam_china_location":"","primarily_steam_deck":false},{"recommendationid":"174216777","author":{"steamid":"76561198052743582","num_games_owned":238,"num_reviews":34,"playtime_forever":10246,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":10246,"last_played":1725891128},"language":"english","review":"Every time I come back to CK3 I am disappointed by how little the game has improved since the last time I played. The game still doesn't have any real difficulty to it, getting OP alliances is still trivial, and you don't even need them 90% of the time. It still feels like a slog to the inevitable.\n\nThe only things they're adding are random notifications and events that even if I read, I do not find interesting anymore. Or mechanics that unnecessarily bloat the game without adding depth, like the most recent legitimacy or plague mechanics. Legitimacy is a nice concept but I never felt in my last 2 runs that its execution made any sense or had any real impact. Overall, compared to at release, to me CK3 now feels like just a more bloated, obnoxious version of the same game.\n\nI always liked the statecraft in the game, developing holdings, culture, religion and a dynasty over time. I feel like updates and DLCs haven't focused on that at all, to the game's detriment. I suppose it took me 170 hours too long to figure out that this game just isn't for me, as I imagine many people probably like these sorts of things about the game.\n\nTL;DR: I think the game gets worse over time, just like Stellaris.
